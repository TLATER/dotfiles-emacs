;; Make eshell clear when using clear
(defun eshell/clear ()
  "Clear the eshell buffer."
  (let ((inhibit-read-only t))
    (erase-buffer)
    (eshell-send-input)))

;; Make eshell open a file in a new window when using emacs
(defun eshell/emacs (&rest args)
  "Open a file in emacs. Some habits die hard."
  (if (null args)
      ;; If I just ran "emacs", I probably expect to be launching
      ;; Emacs, which is rather silly since I'm already in Emacs.
      ;; So just pretend to do what I ask.
      (bury-buffer)
    ;; We have to expand the file names or else naming a directory in an
    ;; argument causes later arguments to be looked for in that directory,
    ;; not the starting directory
    (mapc #'find-file-other-window (mapcar #'expand-file-name (eshell-flatten-list (reverse args))))))

;; Make eshell use sudo sensibly
;; (require 'em-tramp)
;; (setq eshell-prefer-lisp-functions t)
;; (setq eshell-prefer-lisp-variables t)
(setq password-cache t)
(setq password-cache 1200)
